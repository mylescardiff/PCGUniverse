# PCG Universe 1.0
A C++ Procedurally Generated Universe

This project was created as part of my degree in Game Programming from Academy of Ary University in the Procedurally Generated Content class. It generates a galaxy, stars, solar systems, and planets down to the surface details. There's a little gameplay inserted to guide you along the path and see some interesting procedurally generated content.
